title: "Log-Optimal Numeraire for Unattainable Claims"
---


What we will now show is a very interesting result regarding the pricing under the log-optimal numeraire. So far, we have shown for a very general model, that the pricing

$$
\Pi(t;X) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P} \left[ \frac{X}{V^{\pi^*}_T/V^{\pi^*}_t} \Bigg| \mathcal{F}_t \right]
$$ holds for all attainable claims $X$ where $\pi^*$ is the log-optimal portfolio process and $V^{\pi^*}$ its corresponding portfolio value. This exciting results means that the naive pricing can be done under the physical measure $\mathbb{P}$ as long as we were denoting everything to be in the "right" units of "currency" (or numeraire) -- which happens to be the log-optimal portfolio value.

Although an exciting result, there are two main problems this faces for practical implementation. The first is that it is actually hard to achieve the growth optimal portfolio as one would have to know the local rates of mean return, volatilities (across all differing possible sources of noise), and money market rate -- $\mu_t$, $\sigma_t$, $r_t$ at each time. Although these values are themselves random, the model we consider (a generalization of Black-Scholes, local volatility, stochastic volatility, and much else) still assumes that at time $t$ we know what those values are at that instant (although we don't know the resulting shocks due to the noise). Specifying the "ground truth" (random) model is very, very hard in reality!

We will not address this first problem that corresponds to its limited viability in reality. Instead we will deal with a secondary problem. What we have shown so far is a pricing for attainable claims. For unattainable claims (ones we cannot hedge), we may still find a derivative (long or short) compelling based on the price. Thus although one cannot hedge the option, one can still assign their personal value to the option. If going long/short the option (at the observed price) can increase the expected utility of their portfolio, then the investor will buy/sell the option. 

Using utility theory, it is very easy to understand when the investor gains from buying or selling the option. Suppose $\pi$ is the optimal portfolio (among presently traded securities) for an investor with utility function $U$. All of a sudden, an option $\chi$ comes on the market. The option will payout $\chi_T$ at time $T$ and can be bought/sold for $\chi_0$. Without loss of generality, assume $V^\pi_0 = 1$. The investor will be interested (in a small amount) of the option if the initial price $\chi_0$ is such that their expected utility increases by adding a tiny position (long option) to the portfolio. If the option price is such that their expected utility decreases by adding a small amount of long option, then we can show the investor would be interested in the short option position. Thus, we can find the personal price for a given investor of the option as the price such that they are indifferent to adding a small amount of option to their portfolio.

# Marginal Utility Indifference Pricing

We will now derive the idea of a marginal utility indifference price. This will be the price that an investor with a given utility pays for an infinitesimally small amount of a given claim. We identify the utility of the investor (indexed by gamma) as $U_\gamma(x)$.

Assume that an investor currently has an optimal portfolio strategy for their utility function. This gives wealth process $V^{\pi_\gamma}_T$. Without loss of generality, assume $V^{\pi_\gamma}_0 = 1$.

Now consider a claim with payout at time $T$, $\chi_T$. We denote its value (to investor with utility indexed by $\gamma$) at time $0$ by $\chi_0(\gamma)$.

Assuming the investor now allocates $\epsilon$ of their wealth to $\chi$ and $(1-\epsilon)$ to their original ($\gamma$ - utility optimal) strategy, then the investor will be indifferent to adding the option if

$$\frac{d}{d\epsilon} \Bigg|_{\epsilon = 0} \mathbb{E} \left[ U\left((1-\epsilon)V^{\pi_\gamma}_T + \epsilon \frac{\chi_T}{\chi_0}\right)\right] = 0.$$

What this means is that the investor does not gain any expected utility by adding/ removing $\chi$ to their portfolio. In otherwords, they are indifferent to buying or selling the option. What we notice is that whether the above will hold or not depends on the initial price of the option $\chi_0$. Thus we call $\chi_0(\gamma)$ to be the marginal utility indifference price of the option for investor with risk preference parameter $\gamma$. We can solve for $\chi_0(\gamma)$ by computing the derivative and using the linearity of the expectation. Doing this, we get

$$\chi_0(\gamma) = \frac{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) \chi_T \right]}{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) V^{\pi_\gamma}_T\right]},$$

where the expectation is under $\mathbb{P}$. We can write this very suggestively as:

$$
\chi_0(\gamma) = \mathbb{E}[ m_T(\gamma) \chi_T ] 
$$ by taking $$m_T(\gamma) =  \frac{U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) V^{\pi_\gamma}_T \right]}.$$

Thus we have found the natural stochastic discount factor for an investor with a given utility function.

# Log Utility Indifference Pricing

Consider an investor with a log utility function. That is 

$$U_\gamma(x) = \log(x),$$
and denote $V^{\pi^*}_T$ to be the portfolio value for the log utility investor.

Substituting $U'(V^{\pi^*}_T) = \frac{1}{V^{\pi^*}_T}$, we will get:

$$
\chi_0(0) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P} \left[ \frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi^*}_T} \right].$$

In other words, log-utility based investors will price the claim exactly as we have derived before *even* in the case of non-attainable claims.
