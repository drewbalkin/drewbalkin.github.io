title: "Log Optimal Numeraire in Incomplete Markets"

# The Missing Ingredient

What we will now show is a very interesting result regarding the pricing under the log-optimal numeraire. So far, we have shown for a very general model, that the pricing

$$
\Pi(t;X) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P} \left[ \frac{X}{V^{\pi^*}_T/V^{\pi^*}_t} \Bigg| \mathcal{F}_t \right]
$$ holds for all attainable claims $X$ where $\pi^*$ is the log-optimal portfolio process and $V^{\pi^*}$ its corresponding portfolio value. This exciting results means that the naive pricing can be done under the physical measure $\mathbb{P}$ as long as we were denoting everything to be in the "right" units of "currency" (or numeraire) -- which happens to be the log-optimal portfolio.

Although an exciting result, there are two main problems this faces for practical implementation. The first is that it is actually hard to achieve the growth optimal portfolio as one would have to know the local rates of mean return, volatilities (across all differing possible sources of noise), and money market rate -- $\mu_t$, $\sigma_t$, $r_t$ at each time. Although these values are themselves random, the model we consider (a generalization of Black-Scholes, local volatility, stochastic volatility, and much else) still assumes that at time $t$ we know what those values are at that instant (although we don't know the resulting shocks due to the noise). Specifying the "ground truth" (random) model is very, very hard in reality!

We will not address this claim. Instead we will deal with a secondary problem. What we have shown so far is a pricing for attainable claims. For unattainable claims (ones we cannot hedge), we may still find a derivative (long or short) compelling based on the price. Thus although one cannot hedge the option, one can still assign their personal value to the option. If the option (at the observed price) adds value to their portfolio, then the investor will buy the option. If not, they will sell the option.

Using utility theory, it is very easy to understand when the investor gains from buying or selling the option. Suppose $\pi$ is the optimal portfolio (among presently traded securities) for an investor with utility function $U$. All of a sudden, an option $\chi$ comes on the market. The option will payout $\xi_T$ at time $T$ and can be bought/sold for $\chi_0$. Without loss of generality, assume $V^\pi_0 = 1$. The investor will be interested (in a small amount) of the option if the initial price $\chi_0$ is such that their expected utility increases by of their current (utility optimal) portfolio for the option. If the option price is such that their expected utility decreases by adding a small amount of option, then we can show the investor would be interested in the short option position. Thus, we can price (an infinitely small amount of option) for the investor as the price such that they are indifferent to adding a small amount of option to their portfolio.

# Indifference Pricing for all CRRA Utilities

We will now compute the marginal utility indifference price for all CRRA investors. This means that an investor has the utility of the form

$$U(x) = \gamma x^ \gamma$$

for some $\gamma < 1$. This is an arbitrary CRRA utility function. While this seems restrictive, this is a general utility function for the class of investor's who decide on lotteries based purely on return outcomes and not absolute wealth levels. In other words, a CRRA utility investor would have the exact same strategy (dependent entirely on the future distribution of returns) if managing \$1000, \$ 1M or \$1B.

Assume that an investor currently has an optimal portfolio strategy for their utility function. This gives wealth process $V^{\pi_\gamma}_T$. WLOG assume $V^{\pi_\gamma}_0 = 1$.

Now consider a claim with payout at time $T$, $\chi_T$. We denote its value (to investor with utility indexed by $\gamma$) at time $0$ by $\chi_0(\gamma)$.

Assuming the investor now allocates $\epsilon$ of their wealth to $\chi$ and $(1-\epsilon)$ to their original ($\gamma$ - utility optimal) strategy, then the investor will be indifferent to adding the option if

$$\frac{d}{d\epsilon} \Bigg|_{\epsilon = 0} \mathbb{E} \left[ U\left((1-\epsilon)V^{\pi_\gamma}_T + \epsilon \frac{\chi_T}{\chi_0}\right)\right] = 0.$$

What this means is that the investor does not gain any utility by adding/ removing $\chi$ to their portfolio. In otherwords, they are indifferent to buying or selling the option. What we notice is that whether the above will hold or not depends on the initial price of the option $\xi_0$. Thus we call $\xi_0(\gamma)$ to be the marginal utility indifference price of the option for investor with risk tolerance $\gamma$. It turns out we can solve for $\chi_0(\gamma)$ by taking the derivative and using the linearity of the expectation. We actually get that

This corresponds to:

$$\chi_0(\gamma) = \frac{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) \chi_T \right]}{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) V^{\pi_\gamma}_T\right]},$$

where the expectation is under $\mathbb{P}$. We can write this very suggestively as:

$$
\chi_0(\gamma) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[ m_T(\gamma) \chi_T ] 
$$ by taking $$m_T(\gamma) =  \frac{U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) V^{\pi_\gamma}_T \right]}.$$

Thus we have found the natural stochastic discount factor for an investor with a given utility function and now anyone can go home and price options for themselves (assuming they know their utility and the ground truth distribution on future returns)! In fact, we never used CRRA utility and we can just go home knowing what to do for any utility. But actually, we are just getting started.

Note we have for investor with CRRA utility and risk tolerance parameter $\gamma$ that

$$\chi_0(\gamma) = \frac{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) \chi_T \right]}{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) V^{\pi_\gamma}_T\right]}.$$

We know that if the investor has the log utility $\gamma = 0$, then we will have $U'(V^{\pi^*}_T) = \frac{1}{V^{\pi^*}_T}$ so we get the result that we previously knew:

$$
\chi_0(0) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P} \left[ \frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi^*}_T)} \right].$$

That's exciting!!! But wait... not really. No matter what people try to make you believe, not everyone is a log utility investor (trust me, there will be some people who try to convince you otherwise.) In reality, not everyone is a CRRA investor, but the following result is so satisfying, that maybe we can temporarily allow for it.

# The Big Result

We haven't yet used the CRRA utility property. What we will show is that for all $\gamma < 1$, that is for all CRRA risk preferences, we have that $\chi_0(\gamma) = \chi_0(0)$, that is the indifference price is the same for all assets. Because of this, it gives that for all CRRA investors (even with different risk preferences), their indifference price is given by:

$$\chi_0(\gamma) = \mathbb{E} \left[\frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi^*}_T} \right],$$

where $V^{\pi^*}_T$ is the log-optimal portfolio, which was the result we had before for attainable claims!!!

Now, one big caveat is that this is the price for an infinitessimal amount of derivative. The desired price the investor demands may differ if they already and a substantial position in the derivative security. But still, pretty unbelievable result!

## The computation

As before, we assume the following model for $I$ risk assets:

$$\frac{dV^\pi_t}{V^\pi_t} = \sum_{i=1}^I \frac{dS^i_t}{S^i_t}$$ driven by $J$ noises so as to get $$ \frac{dS^i_t}{S^i_t} = \mu^i_t dt + \sum_{j=J}^m \sigma^{ij}_t dW^j_t.$$ Notice how we are temporarily ignoring $r_t$. This can be easily included but it can also be easily excluded by transforming all price processes by using the (temporary) bank account numeraire. This can be easily worked out. The main thing is that the asset local mean returns are understood now as $\mu^i_t - r_t$ (since they are discounted by the bank account). Also, $(\pi^i_t)$ need not add up to $1$ as the remaining amount is taken to be borrowings. This does not enter the immediate picture for dynamics but will play a role when one converts back to units of currency and not bank account. Anyway, with this out of the way we can compute:

$$d \log((V^{\pi_\gamma}_t)^\gamma) = \gamma\frac{dV^{\pi_\gamma}_t}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_t} - \frac{1}{2} \gamma \left(\frac{dV^{\pi_\gamma}_t}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_t} \right)^2.$$

This gives

$$ (V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)^\gamma = \exp \left[ \int_0^T \gamma \left(  \pi_t^T \mu_t -   \frac{1}{2} \pi_t^T \sigma_t \sigma_t^T \pi_t \right) dt + \int_0^T \gamma \pi_t^T \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t \right] .$$

So

$$\mathbb{E}[U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)] = \mathbb{E}[\gamma (V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)^\gamma] = \gamma \exp \left[ \int_0^T  \left(  \gamma \pi_t^T \mu_t -   (\frac{1}{2}\gamma - \frac{1}{2}\gamma^2)  \pi_t^T \sigma_t \sigma_t^T \pi_t \right) dt \right].$$

So if $Ker(\sigma^T) = \varnothing$ then the optimal portfolio occurs at $$ \pi_t = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}(\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t,$$ which corresponds to $\pi_t = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}(\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} (\mu_t - r_t \vec{1})$ under the appropriate transformation of $\mu_t$ understood to be the currency mean rate of return of stocks rather than the bank account numeraire denominated mean rate of return.

In reality, $Ker(\sigma^T) = \varnothing$ which corresponds to absence of arbitrage in the underlying assets, and thus we have the unique portfolio strategy for each given risk preference. With everything somewhat explicit, we can easily compute the indifference price

$$\chi_0 = \frac{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) \chi_T \right]}{\mathbb{E} \left[ U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) V^{\pi_\gamma}_T\right]}$$

and show it is the same for each $\gamma$.

First, notice the CRRA utility satisfies $U'(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) = \gamma \frac{U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_T}$. This allows us to write:

$$\chi_0 = \frac{\mathbb{E} \left[ U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T) \frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_T} \right]}{\mathbb{E} [ U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)]} = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{\mathbb{E} [ U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)]} \frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_T} \right].$$

First

$$ V^{\pi_\gamma}_T = \exp \left[ \int_0^T\left(  \pi_t^T \mu_t -   \frac{1}{2} \pi_t^T \sigma_t \sigma_t^T \pi_t \right) dt + \int_0^T  \pi_t^T \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t \right] $$

where $\pi_t = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}(\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t$. So we have

$$ V^{\pi_\gamma}_T = \exp \left[ \int_0^T \frac{\frac{1}{2} - \gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt + \int_0^T \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t  \right] .$$

Next

$$ (V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)^\gamma = \exp \left[ \int_0^T \gamma \frac{\frac{1}{2} - \gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt + \int_0^T \frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t  \right] .$$

Therefore

$$\frac{U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{\mathbb{E} [ U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)]} = \exp \left[ \int_0^T -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma} \right)^2 \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt + \int_0^T \frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t  \right]$$

Thus

$$ \frac{U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{\mathbb{E} [ U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)]} \frac{1}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_T}   =   \exp \left[ \int_0^T \frac{-1}{2} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt - \int_0^T \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t  \right]$$

and hence the indifference price is then:

$$\chi_0 = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)}{\mathbb{E} [ U(V^{\pi_\gamma}_T)]} \frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi_\gamma}_T} \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{\chi_T}{\exp \left[ \int_0^T \frac{1}{2} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt + \int_0^T \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t  \right]}  \right].$$

Lastly note that the log-optimal portfolio corresponds to

$$\pi^*_t = (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t$$ and its corresponding portfolio process is $V^{\pi^*}_T = \exp \left[ \int_0^T \frac{1}{2} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt + \int_0^T \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t \right]$.

Thus each CRRA investor has the indifference price:

$$\chi_0 = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{\chi_T}{\exp \left[ \int_0^T \frac{1}{2} \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \mu_t dt + \int_0^T \mu_t^T (\sigma_t \sigma_t^T)^{-1} \sigma_t d\vec{W}_t  \right]}  \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{\chi_T}{V^{\pi^*}_T} \right],$$

EVEN in the case of non-attainable claims.
