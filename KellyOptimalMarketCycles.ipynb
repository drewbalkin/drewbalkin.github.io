        "# Overview\n",
        "This post finds a Kelly optimal portfolio allocation depending on PE ratio of an underlying stock index. We assume that the earnings of the index as well as the market multiple are exogenous variables described by SDEs. The earnings of the index are driven by a Geometric Brownian Motion, while the earnings yield is driven by a modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with parameters determined from historical data. We construct the Kelly optimal portfolio through neural networks as well as analytically showcasing that neural networks can be used to solve similar problems of this form in the case when no analytical solutions exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make such a model useful, we will have to construct a more realistic model of valuation and impact on return. The main problem with this model is that earnings is given by a GBM which in particular means it is Markov. The problem with this perspective is that the current earnings level is not the best predictor of future earnings. Because of this, PE ratios can appear artificially low or high as the current earnings may not demonstrate the actual (probabilistic) future earnings power. For instance, in 2009 earnings were near $0$ but immediately recovered to levels near previous years. This would cause PE ratios to be overstated. However, the model we use assumes that earnings are Markovian in nature and hence valuation is completely understood in terms of the trailing PE ratio (as the distribution of future earnings depends only on the current earnings).\n",

        "\n",
        "Suppose we have a stock or fund with price at time $t$ given by $S_t$. The price of the stock discounts future dividends as it is a claim on future (stochastic) dividends, where the dividends are discounted not only by time but by their risk. So how does $S_t$ then change over time?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Dividends are paid out.\n",
        "2. The probability distribution of future dividends changes.\n",
        "3. The risk preferences of investors change.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "So one component of the return (and the stochastic nature of the stock return) is from directly receiving the random stochastic payments given by the process $(D_t)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second component of return is that this probabilistic future stream of dividends changes over time. That is the outlook changes so the probability distribution of these dividends change as well. This causes a price change as the market reacts to how the dividend changes throughout time.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is a third component to return. Even if the probability distribution of future dividends were not to change over a time interval $[t,t+dt]$, it is still possible that the market is willing to change its mind and pay a different price for this exact same stream of future dividends.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our model, we will model the first component through the actual payment of dividends, the second component by modelling the dividend process, and the third component by a market multiple process. This corresponds to the three components of total stock return: dividends, dividend growth, and market multiple changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that a company or stock index may not pay all excess profits or earnings as dividends. Other options are buybacks, acquisitions, or reinvestment. As for buybacks, we can treat this exactly the same as a reinvested dividend so we can pretend that buybacks are simply a part of the dividend distribution. The other two are not and would affect the dividend growth rate. However, if we assume that acquisitions / reinvestment is done at a similar rate of return as compared to owning the security, we can just assume earnings are just glorified dividends with respect to our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "From now on, we will treat dividends as earnings. We assume that earnings as a whole are paid out to the investor as if it were a dividend. After all, the profit at time $t$ is distributed to shareholders one way or another whether it is dividends, buybacks, acquisitions, or reinvestment. It is dangerous to include all of these as \"dividend\" payments, however it will be simplifying assumption for our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this model, we will have a stock index whose profits (or dividends by our assumption) at time $t$ is given by the process $D_t$ where $D_tdt$ represents the total dividend payment in $[t,t+dt]$ for owning $1$ unit of stock. This dividend process will be given by a geometric Brownian motion with mean $\\mu_D$ and volatility $\\sigma_D$. Separately, there is a market multiple process $M_t$ which represents the amount the market is willing to pay for the stock given its current dividend. Simply, if $S_t$ is stock price at time $t$, then $D_t M_t = S_t$. To model the market multiple process, we model its inverse, the dividend yield process $y_t = \\frac{1}{M_t} = \\frac{D_t}{S_t}$ with an OU model, which is common for interest rates as it allows for mean reversion. This gives the model\n",

        "\n",
        "We can think of our ownership of a stock at time $t$ as a claim on the future dividends $(D_s)_{s \\geq t}$, where the amount $D_s ds$ per share is paid to the stockholder's over time $[s,s+ds]$.Therefore, we can understand the price of the stock as the present value of all future dividends:\n",

        "where $Q$ is the risk-neutral measure. In fact, one might have some objection to the above in that the dividends aren't themselves hedgeable claims (outside of the corresponding stock which we are trying to price!). This is not really a problem as the above pricing need not arise from an arbitrage pricing arguement (see [part 3 of my blog post on indifference pricing with the log-optimal portfolio](./logoptimal3.qmd) for instance). What is true is that $Q$ represents the discounting for risk of the dividend streams and hence its existence can be viewed from the markets desired risk preferences.\n",

To emphasize that $Q$ is itself time dependent, we write the expectation under $Q$ instead under the true physical measure $P$ with some time dependent stochastic discount factor $m(\\cdot,t)$.

However, I cannot get the 1930s view on future dividends from historical data. This *might* be *somewhat* possible in more recent years due to the options market allowing one to reconstruct the implied distribution $Q$, however it may be hard to extract the $Q$ distribution for the dividend specifically.

What is meant by dividend yield here is the instantaneous dividend yield. If $t$ is measured in years where $t=1$ for instance is 1 year, then the annualized dividend yield. The second aspect of P&L over $[t,t+dt]$ is given by the change in stock price-- the price return. The price return consists of price change due to dividend change and also market multiple changes. Simply however, we can calculate it as follows. The stock price return is $\\frac{dS_t}{S_t}$ and $\\pi_t X_t$ is invested in the stock so the P&L from stock price change is given by $\\pi_t X_t \\frac{dS_t}{S_t}$.

        "One simple technique is to solve the stochastic optimal control problem with neural networks. Essentially, we take the control $\\pi_t$ to be a neural network which inputs the known information at time $t$ and outputs a proposed portfolio allocation to the stock fund. The loss function is then taken to be a numerical estimate of $-\\mathbb{E} [\\log(X_T)]$ which is used to train the neural network.\n",

In other words, we decide our portfolio allocation based on the current state of our wealth, the dividend, and dividend yield, and the current time. Logically, we should expect to see that in reality $\\pi_t = \\pi(t,y_t)$. That is the only relevant information to decide the portfolio allocation should be the current time $t$ (because the model ends at time $T$) and the current dividend yield $y_t$ as we decide whether we think stocks are expensive or not, as well as how important that is to the portfolio allocation. Since we are calculating the expected value of the $\\log(\\cdot)$, a myopic utility function, it will turn out the true optimal portfolio does not depend on time $t$, but only dividend yield $y_t$. However, for our numerical approach, this is not necessary and we can pretend we did not know any better.\n",

        "1. The model was trained to be optimal on an OU process for earnings yield and a GBM for real earnings. If the true dynamics are not adequately captured by this model, then the Kelly portfolio for this fake model will not perform adequately. Moreover, if past parameters differ than those in the future (i.e. if there is a permanently higher valuation demanded by the market for instance), the model is not optimal for this setting.\n",

If the data for earnings does not accurately represent the true earnings power of the SP500 (i.e. overstated or understated) then the model may become too optimistic or too pessimistic at the wrong times. This is especially true when valuations look cheap or expensive for a reason! If the optical valuation does not agree with true valuation, then the model will perform poorly as it allocates based on CAPE.\n",

        "3. The model exhibited outperformance vs the 2x levered SP500 until around 1990 (see plot below). Substantial changes have happened in this period including: new accounting policies which might make modern CAPEs and PEs seem artificially high compared to their past values, dividend payout policies which can distort data for CAPE and PE, and a rise in corporations which emphasize intangible value and so-called \"investing through the balance sheet\" meaning that true profitability can be understated. Another part of the change since 1990 has been increased corporate margins causing real earnings growth to exceed its historical average. One might wonder what caused this change-- is it lasting or potentially subject to mean reversion?\n"

This caused the naive 200% portfolio to catch up dramatically. However, there is another period which shows a great failure of this method. From 1915-1920, (see below) the stock market looked very cheap on a PE and CAPE basis (continuing to look cheap on a CAPE basis past 1920). However, there was a dramatic deflationary recession from 1920-1921. Simply put, real earnings exhibited volatility way higher than what the fitted model would expect. The models were basically allocating at max leverage of 300% in this period. This goes to show that a visibly cheap market is still subject to extreme crashes that was not factored in on the model for which the Kelly portfolio strategy was trained. The 1920 real earnings crash may be the reason the market appeared so cheap prior in potential anticipation for such a crash.\n"
