I am Drew Balkin, a PhD student in Mathematics with a deep interest in all-things finance. I enjoy mixing the tools and techniques of quantitative finance with the traditional viewpoints of finance on fundamental valuation.

My personal goal is to use mathematics to model market phenomenon based on fundamental principles that will result in a greater understanding of market dynamics.

## Academic Research

As for my background, I am completing my PhD in mathematics from UC Santa Barbara with a graduation date in September of 2023. In this time, I have studied machine learning methods for solving stochastic optimal control problems and stochastic differential games. You can view some of my papers

-   [Stochastic Delay Differential Games: Financial Modeling and Machine Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06450.pdf) showcases a methodology to solve stochastic delay differential games with machine learning and highlights various financial problems that can be solved with this technique.

-   [Optimal Policies for a Pandemic: A Stochastic Game Approach and a Deep Learning Algorithm](https://msml21.github.io/papers/id42.pdf) models Covid-19 dynamics in a game theoretic setting whereby an individual region's policies interact with those of other regions. Deep learning techniques are used to find the Nash equilibrium for this problem. This paper was published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research vol 145:1--26, 2021 2nd Annual Conference on Mathematical and Scientific Machine Learning.

-   [Pandemic Control, Game Theory, and Machine Learning](ams.org/journals/notices/202211/rnoti-p1878.pdf) provides a survey on stochastic control and differential games applied to Covid-19 as well as the deep learning techniques which allows for solutions to these difficult problems. This was featured in the American Mathematical Society (AMS) Notices.

## Blog Projects and Research

For this blog, I wanted to highlight some of my thoughts in a more accessible and informal manner. In part, some work is inspired by my academic research such as my blog post on [valuation based Kelly optimal portfolios for market cycle investing](./KellyOptimalMarketCycles.qmd). Some of the work in this blog is just my own personal excursion into financial math topics of great interest to me that are relatively uncovered in the financial literature. While the results are known if you are willing to dig deep, I show my own derivations of how the log-optimal portfolio can be used in option pricing in a surprisingly general manner (see the "Log Optimal Portfolio and Option Pricing" blog posts [part 1](./logoptimal1.qmd), [part 2](./logoptimal2.qmd), and [part 3](./logoptimal3.qmd)).

### Valuation-based Kelly Optimal Portfolios for Market Cycle Investing

Every financial asset can be viewed in terms of its random payoff dynamics. In particular,

-   Debt is a claim on future payoffs in units of a given currency. The payoff may be random in nature due to the unknown purchasing power of the deterministic currency payouts as well as from the potential for default.

-   Equity is a claim on future profits net of debt repayments. A company need not pay its net profit as dividend but it gets reinvested one way or another for the purpose of future dividends. The future profitability of a company or enterprise is clearly random in nature.

Individual investors can then price assets based on the desire for the cohesive random payout dynamics of the assets. The underlying asset prices are not exogenous, but rather endogenous variables arising from the aggregate portfolio construction of all investors.

However, what about the fact that individuals can have risk preferences that change through time? Secondly, how much buying and selling of equities is not fundamental-- i.e. driven without regard for valuation? These two factors, changing risk preferences and valuation agnostic investing, may cause the market to exhibit cycles of differing valuations-- cycles which are more behavioral rather than rational.

Assuming this is true, how should one allocate given the existence of these market cycles?

I offer a very simple model to offer the start of a framework for this question. I hope to develop this into a more robust model in the future. This work is included in my blog post on [Kelly Optimal portfolios in earnings driven financial markets](./KellyOptimalMarketCycles.qmd).


### Log-Optimal Portfolio and Option Pricing

Traditionally, financial derivatives are priced as their discounted payout under a risk neutral measure. I was intrigued by an approach that I rediscovered which shows the price of the derivative is actually its payout under the physical measure when a certain unit of account (or numeraire) was considered. Specifically, if one takes as unit of account the so-called "log-optimal portfolio", then the option's price is exactly the expected value of the option's payout under the true physical measure! In other words, pricing a derivative/security/asset in units of log-optimal portfolio naturally discounts for risk and time! Not only is this true, but it holds in very general frameworks.

While the results are known, I want to present this knowledge in a non-technical fashion for someone who is somewhat experienced with stochastic calculus and exposed to the usual risk-neutral option pricing framework in the same way I rediscovered these results. Here are my lecture notes on this topic starting from [the basic case of a traditional Black-Scholes model](./logoptimal1.qmd), and then to [the case for the generalized model for all attainable claims](./logoptimal2.qmd). In fact, this framework is even true for a [utility based pricing in the case of unattainable claims](./logoptimal3.qmd)!
