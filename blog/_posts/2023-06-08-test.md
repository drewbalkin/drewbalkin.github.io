title:  "Optimal Portfolio Allocation in Earnings Driven Financial Market"
---

In this model, we will have a stock whose profits (or dividends by our assumption) at time $t$ is given by the process $D_t$ where $D_tdt$ represents the total dividend payment in $[t,t+dt]$ for owning $1$ unit of stock. This dividend process will be given by a GBM with mean $\mu$ and volatility $\sigma_D$. Seperately, there is a market multiple process $M_t$ which represents the amount the market is willing to pay for the stock given its current dividend. Simply, if $S_t$ is stock price at time $t$, then $D_t M_t = S_t$. To model the market multiple process, we model its inverse, the dividend yield process $y_t = \frac{1}{M_t} = \frac{D_t}{S_t}$ with an OU model. This is a common model for interest rates and thus makes sense for earnings yield. Thus our model is:

$$dD_t = \mu D_t dt + \sigma_D D_t dW^1_t$$

$$dy_t = -\theta(y_t-y_{eq})dt + \sigma_y dW^2_t$$

We assume for now that the brownian motions $W^1,W^2$ are independent.

From our exogeneos dividend and dividend yield processes, we have an endogenous stock price process determined by the two. Simply we know $S_t = \frac{D_t}{y_t}$. Now we can model our full problem. Let $X_t$ be the investor's wealth at time and $\pi_t$ be the fraction of wealth in which the investor invests in stocks. 

Over time $[t,t+dt]$ the investor will receive dividends equal to the amount of $\pi_t X_t y_t dt$ as they have $\pi_t X_t$ invested in the stock which has a dividend yield of $y_t$. What is meant by dividend yield here is the instantaneous dividend yield. The second aspect of P&L over $[t,t+dt]$ is given by the change in stock price-- the price return. The price return consists of price change due to dividend change (i.e. dividend growth) and also market multiple changes. Simply however, we can calculate it as follows. The stock price return is $\frac{dS_t}{S_t}$ and $\pi_t X_t$ is invested in the stock so the P&L from stock price change is given by $\pi_t X_t \frac{dS_t}{S_t}$. Adding these two components of P&L together we get that $dX_t = \pi_t X_t y_t dt + \pi_t X_t \frac{dS_t}{S_t}$.

Writing this in terms of our exogenous variables $D_t$ and $y_t$, we get that the dynamics for the wealth process $X_t$ are given by:

$$dX_t = \pi_t X_t y_t dt + \pi_t X_t \frac{d(D_t/y_t)}{D_t/y_t}$$

Applying Ito's lemma, we get that


$$dX_t = \pi_t X_t y_t dt + \pi_t X_t \frac{dD_t}{D_t} + \pi_t X_t \frac{d(1/y_t)}{1/y_t} + \pi_t X_t \frac{dD_t d(1/y_t)}{D_t/y_t} $$

The last term is $0$ as $dW^1_t dW^2_t = 0$. Thus we get 

$$dX_t = \pi_t X_t y_t dt + \pi_t X_t\frac{dD_t}{D_t} + \pi_t X_t \frac{d(1/y_t)}{1/y_t}  $$

Factoring out the total stock allocation $\pi_t X_t$, we see that this is saying that the return of investing in a stock is given by

$$ y_t dt +  \frac{dD_t}{D_t} + \frac{d(1/y_t)}{1/y_t},$$

which is the dividend yield percent + percent dividend growth rate + percent change in multiple. The total return process is the process that models growth of 1 dollar completely invested in stocks with reinvested dividends. By setting $\pi_t = 1$ and thus $X_t = TR_t$ by definition of total return, we get that the total return process is

$$dTR_t =  TR_t[ y_t dt +  \frac{dD_t}{D_t} +  \frac{d(1/y_t)}{1/y_t} ]. $$


Anyway we are concerned with the following problem:


$$dD_t  = \mu D_t dt + \sigma_D D_t dW^1_t $$

$$dy_t  = -\theta(y_t-y_{eq})dt + \sigma_y dW^2_t$$

$$dX_t  = \pi_t X_t y_t dt + \pi_t X_t \frac{dD_t}{D_t} + \pi_t X_t \frac{d(1/y_t)}{1/y_t}$$

$$max_{\pi} E[\log(X_T)]$$
